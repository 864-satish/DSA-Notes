# ðŸ“– Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems. This article provides a detailed exploration of dynamic programming concepts, illustrated with examples. (GFG)

To solve dynamic programming problem, we need to answer 2 questions:

- How to represent each subproblem state.
- What is the transition from the subproblem to the current problem.
