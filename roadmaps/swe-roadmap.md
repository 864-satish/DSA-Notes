# üìñ Becoming a Software Engineer at Google

This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap to prepare for the toughest coding problems asked in Google onsite and virtual interviews. Based on insights from multiple Googlers and experience from solving over 1,000 data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems, this guide will help you navigate through the preparation process and succeed in your Google coding rounds.

## üó∫Ô∏è Google Onsite Interview Process

### Interview Format
- **3 Virtual Onsite Coding Interviews**: All interviews follow the same format.
- **Question Difficulty**: Medium to hard coding questions.
- **Duration**: 45 minutes (strict cutoff).
  1. **Introduction**: 2-3 minutes.
  2. **Explaining and Coding Your Approach**: 40 minutes.
  3. **Questions from Your End**: 2-5 minutes.

## ü™® Hardest DSA Concepts Asked in Google Onsite Interviews

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
2. **Graph**
3. **Segment Tree**
4. **Fenwick Tree**
5. **Bit Manipulation**

## üìö Detailed Tips to Tackle Each Concept

### 1. Dynamic Programming (DP) ‚èÆÔ∏è

- **Preparation**: Topic-wise.
- **Practice**: Solve at least 2 problems on all unique DP patterns.
- **Patterns to Cover**:
  1. **1-D DP**: Fibonacci, Coin Change.
  2. **2-D DP**: Unique Paths, Minimum Path Sum.
  3. **Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM)**: Burst Balloons, Optimal Parenthesization.
  4. **Knapsack**: 0/1 Knapsack, Subset Sum, Partition Equal Subset Sum.
  5. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) + Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**.
  6. **Interval DP**: Non-overlapping Intervals, Maximum Earnings from Taxi.
  7. **String DP**: Edit Distance, Regex Matching.

### 2. Graph üìà

- **Strategy**: Divide and conquer due to vastness.
- **Basics**: Learn basic graph theory from any CS book or YouTube playlist.
- **Practice**: Solve at least 2 problems on all graph patterns.
  1. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**.
  2. **Cycle Detection**: Using DFS/Kahn's Algorithm/Topological Sort.
  3. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Using Prim's/Kruskal's Algorithm.
  4. **Node Coloring**: Bipartite Graph/M-coloring.
  5. **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.

### 3. Segment Trees üå≤

- **Alternative Solutions**: Many segment tree problems can be solved using other DSAs such as Merge Sort, HashSet/MultiSet, DSU, Line Sweep, and Offline Queries.
- **Approaches**:
  1. **Skip Segment Trees**: Master solving segment tree problems using alternative DSAs.
  2. **Master Segment Trees**: Use them to solve problems requiring O(n log n) time complexity.

### 4. Fenwick Trees ‚òòÔ∏è

- **Comparison**: Similar to segment trees but with much smaller code (10-15 lines).
- **Advantage**: Can be an edge in a 45-minute interview.
- **Strategy**: If mastering segment trees, learn Fenwick trees as well.

### 5. Bit Manipulation 0Ô∏è‚É£/1Ô∏è‚É£

- **Personal Struggle**: Initially challenging but ultimately rewarding.
- **Three-Step Process**:
  1. **Know Your Operands**: LEFT/RIGHT shift, XOR, AND, OR, NOT.
  2. **Study Properties**:
     - **LEFT/RIGHT Shift**: Get a particular bit.
     - **XOR**: Find a single element when others exist twice.
     - **AND/OR**: Mask/Unmask a number.
  3. **Practice**: Solve 5 problems on each property and repeat.
- **Mindset**: It may be tough initially to visualize bits and shifts, but with practice, you will be able to recognize and solve problems using bit manipulation confidently.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Resources to Prepare for Google Coding Interviews

### 1. For Your DSA Theoretical Concepts
- **Book**: [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://t.ly/q4kuG)
  - Highly recommended, personally used
  - Massive book, so selective study is the way to go.
  - Pick a subtopic, read theory on just that
  - Solve interview questions given at the end of the chapter
- **Playlists**:
  - [Tushar Roy](https://youtu.be/8LusJS5-AGo?si=P1y7Xun8IZTPtVyL)
  - [Abdul Bari](https://youtu.be/0IAPZzGSbME?si=CyTKWVXIdXfRlQ-H)
  - [Aditya Verma](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAdityaVerma)
  - [TUF](https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward)
  - Any other DSA content creator whose explanations you get
  - Again, these creators have huge playlists, so watch them selectively.
  - A good thumb rule is do 5 problems on a subtopic/pattern and move on to next.

### 2. For DSA Practice
- **Google Tagged LC Questions**: [LeetCode Google Tag](https://leetcode.ca/tags/#Google)
- **LeetCode**: [LeetCode Problem Set](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
- **HackerRank**: [HackerRank Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures)

### 3. For DSA Contests (Getting Faster at Coding)
- **LeetCode**: Biweekly & Weekly contests
- **Codeforces**: Div 1-4 contests
- **Codechef**: Starter contests

### 4. Miscellaneous
- [LC/Cf/CChef Contest Reminder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/codingdude-contest-remind/gceicoplhhmgcoanpkbnopdccpghbngk)
- Practice DSA problem with Timer

## Conclusion

By following this guide and diligently preparing with the recommended strategies and practice problems, you will be well-equipped to tackle the coding challenges presented in Google interviews. Good luck on your journey to becoming a software engineer at Google! üåü
